# Unit Source Weight Inversions using Deep Learning

Author: Christopher Liu

A collection of scripts used to,
* Process and download time series data for the fakequakes and unit sources
* Generate training, validation, and testing data sets.
* Training and predicting with a 1D convolutional neural network
* Plotting results

for unit source inversions as a part of NCTR's SIFT(Short-term Inundation Forecasting for Tsunamis) system.
